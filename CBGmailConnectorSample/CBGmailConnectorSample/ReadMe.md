The CBGmailConnector uses OAuth 2.0 to handle authentication and authorization.

The overall process of developing CBGmailConnector exploiting the API consists of the following steps:
- Definition of the backbone of CBGmailConnector.
- Definition of the metamodel for Gmail API concepts.
- Generate a SQL statement to execute against the Gmail API and retrieve data.
