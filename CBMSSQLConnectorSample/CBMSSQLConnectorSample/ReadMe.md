# CBMSSQLConnectorSample
This sample shows how to implement a simple connector for Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) using CB Connector SDK. 

The overall process of developing CBMSSQLConnectorSample exploiting the API consists of the following steps:
- Definition of the backbone of CBMSSQLConnectorSample.
- Definition of the metamodel for MSSQL concepts.
- Generate a SQL statement to execute against MSSQL and retrieve data.
